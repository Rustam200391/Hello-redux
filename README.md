My first app to understand redux

To use Redux, you do not need to download additional libraries, but if you use it in conjunction with the React-redux library, development becomes even more convenient and easier.

Redux is a JavaScript implementation of Flux. This implementation is convenient to use in web applications to manage the overall global state. It has a special binding for use with React.

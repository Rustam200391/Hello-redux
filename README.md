My first app to understand redux

To use Redux, you do not need to download additional libraries, but if you use it in conjunction with the React-redux library, development becomes even more convenient and easier.

Redux is a JavaScript implementation of Flux. This implementation is convenient to use in web applications to manage the overall global state. It has a special binding for use with React.

To clone an application, you need to run the command in the terminal: "git clone" and enter the url of the github repository specified when clicking on the "code" button in the url tab.

You need to clone while in the folder where the application will be located.
